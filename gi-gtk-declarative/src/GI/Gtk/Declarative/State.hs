-- | The 'StateTree' and 'SomeState' form a "shadow state"
-- representation, used in patching. Declarative widgets can return,
-- and later on reuse, its underlying GTK+ widget, collected
-- properties and classes, style context, custom internal state, and
-- child states. This reduces the need for querying GTK+ widgets
-- excessively, and recalculating/resetting, greatly improving the
-- performance of patching.
