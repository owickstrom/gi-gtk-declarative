-- | The declarative layer on top of GTK+ lets you describe your user
-- interface as a declarative hierarchy of objects, using data
-- structures and pure functions. You can leverage the declarative event
-- handling to build reusable widgets. The "Patch" typeclass, and the
-- instances provided by this library, performs minimal updates to GTK+ widgets
-- using the underlying imperative operations, so that your rendering can always
-- be a pure function your state to a "Widget".
